                                        I'm very proficient with 
                                        HTML, CSS and Javascript (especially CSS), and am also experienced with Java, C, Python and Requirements Engineering.

                                    <p>I'm also a huge fan of Mark Rosewater (Head Designer of Magic: The Gathering). Game theory and game design (particularly tabletop) 
                                        are big interests of mine. Of course, I'm also an avid Magic player, so hit me up if you'd be interested in 
                                        playing some EDH.
